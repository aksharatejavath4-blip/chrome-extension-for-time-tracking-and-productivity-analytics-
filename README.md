##DESCRIPTION

PROJECT REPORT:CHROME EXTENSION FOR TIME TRACKING AND PRODUCTIVITY ANALYTICS

Building a Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics for the final milestone of my CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS internship was a unique and rewarding challenge. Unlike standard web applications, this task required me to step inside the browser’s ecosystem to create a tool that observes, analyzes, and reports on user behavior in real-time. The primary goal was to develop a utility that helps users combat digital distractions by providing a transparent look at how they allocate their time across various websites. This project serves as a sophisticated bridge between frontend design and background system processes, proving that web technologies can be used to build powerful productivity tools that live right in the browser toolbar.​To develop this extension, my primary platform was Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Working in VS Code was essential because it allowed me to manage the specific file structure required for a Chrome extension, including the manifest, background scripts, and popup interfaces, all within a single workspace. I also relied heavily on the Chrome Extensions Management interface in "Developer Mode" to load my "unpacked" extension. This allowed for a rapid, iterative development cycle where I could refresh the extension and see my code changes immediately. For debugging, I used the browser’s built-in Developer Tools, specifically the "Service Worker" console and the "Network" tab, to ensure that time-tracking events were firing correctly and that data was being saved without errors.​The technology stack I selected was intentionally lightweight to ensure the extension would not slow down the user’s browsing experience. I utilized HTML5 and CSS3 for the "Popup Dashboard," which is the small window that appears when a user clicks the extension icon. The logic was powered by Vanilla JavaScript, leveraging the Chrome Extension Manifest V3 architecture. One of the most important technical tools I used was the Chrome Storage API, which allowed me to persist user data locally on their machine. I also implemented a Background Service Worker, a script that runs silently in the background to monitor tab activity, URL changes, and active browsing durations without requiring the user to keep any specific window open.​The implementation strategy focused on high-precision tracking and intelligent categorization. The extension works by detecting when a tab becomes active and logging a "start timestamp". When the user switches tabs or closes the browser, the script calculates the elapsed time and attributes it to that specific website domain. I added a layer of Productivity Analytics by creating a classification system that checks domains against specific keywords. For instance, time spent on platforms like GitHub or Stack Overflow is categorized as "Productive," while time spent on social media or entertainment sites is flagged as "Unproductive". This data is then aggregated to show the user a visual breakdown of their focus levels, helping them understand their daily habits.​This project has significant real-world applicability, particularly in the growing Remote Work and Freelance economies. Professionals can use this type of tool to track billable hours accurately or to identify time-wasting habits that hinder their efficiency. It is also highly relevant in the Digital Wellness space, where users seek tools to help them regain control over their screen time. From a developer's perspective, this project demonstrates a mastery of Asynchronous Programming and API Integration, as well as a commitment to user privacy, since all tracking and storage are handled locally on the user's device rather than on a central server.​Completing this final task has been a great way to round out my internship with CODTECH. I have moved from building basic web pages to creating specialized, system-level utilities that provide real value to users. This project showcases my ability to handle full-stack challenges—from designing an accessible dashboard to writing complex background logic—and serves as a strong conclusion to my technical portfolio.​
